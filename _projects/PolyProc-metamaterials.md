Levitation is defined as an *"equilibrium state of an object that allows suspension without contact".* Most levitation is today obtained using **magnetic levitation**, meaning that it relies on magnetic fields to achieve levitation. This kind of levitation is quite cool, as can be seen in the images below. It can be used to make complex mechanisms such as [magnetic gears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_gear). The main drawback is that **it only works for magnetic materials, which is not the case for polymers**.

The left GIF shows a cheap planter you can get online that allows your plant to levitate. It uses magnets. The right GIF shows magnetic levitation that uses superconductors (and liquid nitrogen to keep them cool, that's where the "smoke" comes from).

A possible solution to that issue could be the usage of **multiple sound waves** that combine to form a **pressure node**. Pressure nodes act as a trap for small particles that can make small polymeric particles levitate. Such a setup can be obtained by using parallel grids of transducers that generate a specific field that contains certain traps. We however decided to instead reproduce the work Polychronopouls and Memoli [^1] who developed a method to devise complex acoustic levitators using a single grid of transducer array and a 3D printed part, a grid of parallel surfaces of different heights. Such surfaces, that are specifically designed to reflect acoustic waves in a specific way, are called **metamaterials**.

All the images presented here are from Polychronopoulos et al[^1]. The image in the top right shows what a 3D-printed metamaterials look like, it's a grid of parallel surfaces that have different heights. Each surface will be used to reflect the wave from the transducer directly in front of it. The bottom left image presents a colored version of the metamaterial. The 3 bottom images show a pressure field that was optimized to trap 2 particles. It's possible that 2 particles are indeed trapped and levitating in the bottom middle right image using a metamaterial.
