The mechanical properties of a material, and more particularly its tensile properties, are determined through mechanical tests during which **a load is applied to a specimen whose deformation is measured**. The understanding and ability to reproduce these tests with rigor is essential for any engineer.

The animation on the left presents the evolution of the deformation along the vertical direction for a 3D printed EFEP (fluoropolymer) dogbone under tensile (vertical) loading. This material exhibits a final strain of more than 300% during a tensile test. This work was done with [Yahya Abderrafai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yahya-abderrafai-5207953b/?originalSubdomain=ca) and [Charlotte Weever](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-weever-1117307b/) for 3D-TRIP. The animation on the right presents a contour plot of the strain along the principal direction of a pre-cracked chitosan *(thick)* film. This work was done in collaboration with [Qinghua Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qinghua-wu-90968210b/).

The uniaxial tensile test is the most commonly used procedure for measuring these mechanical properties, which include Young's modulus, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. Commercial tensile testers are very accurate, but their cost and size make them impractical for hands-on learning in the classroom. In addition, they often require expensive proprietary software to operate with software licensing agreements that sometimes preclude their use for teaching activities... 
Recently, the Open Source movement has successfully built equipment and software that is not yet commercially available or is too expensive. The aim of this project is to develop a mechanical testing device, capable of performing a tensile test, inexpensive and portable, which could be used both for precise measurements and for educational and teaching purposes at baccalaureate level, but also for extension activities.

Arrizabalaga et al [^1] have presented a publication in which a "mini" tensile testing machine capable of testing films and sheets (with a load cell capacity of 5kg) was shown to provide results with an accuracy comparable to the one of commerical testing equipment, making it accurate enough for teaching needs. This projects aims at reproducing a similar equipment with a load cell that has a slightly higher capacity in order to be able to test thin plastic specimens or even some kind of composites.
