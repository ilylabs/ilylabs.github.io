The blimp or zeppelin is an aircraft, also called **aerostat**, that has the essential characteristic of being **lighter-than-air**. Airship technologies have known a golden age in the early twentieth century followed by a sudden decline with the advent of commercial aviation. During their short popular era, several dramatic accidents involving blimps have tainted the reputation of such vehicles. 
Recent developments of drones, mainly quadcopters, have allowed for their usage in **several indoor cases** (exploration). However, the limited capacity of quadcopters limits their capabilities for long-duration missions. 
However, in recent years, with the development of new materials, new knowledge, and possibilities in automation, aerostats offer an alternative transport solution with **less energy consumption**. This characteristic would allow for **longer missions**.

[Prof. David St-Onge](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/dastonge/) at Ã‰TS specializes in the study and development of indoor aerostats. His lab, the [INIT Robots lab](https://initrobots.ca/en/), also focuses on the study of the natural interaction between humans and complex systems, such as aerostat drones. He is leading a project that aims at **developing lightweight rigid structures that could be part of the envelope of an indoor aerostat**. Since indoor aerostats must face **obstacles and impacts**, while outdoor blimps don't, their structure must be modified to consider their environment. Another main difference between outdoor and indoor aerostats is the required maneuverability: because they have to **maneuver within restrained spaces**. A semi-rigid structure could be leveraged to provide a better maneuverability.
