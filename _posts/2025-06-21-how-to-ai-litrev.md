I've just published a new video demonstrating my personal workflow for conducting efficient literature reviews, particularly when delving into new research areas. This guide is designed to help students and researchers quickly grasp the state-of-the-art in any field by leveraging powerful AI-driven tools.

The video provides a direct and practical approach, showcasing how to integrate various digital tools to streamline the initial stages of your literature review.

### What the Video Covers:

* **Strategic Literature Search:** Learn how to initiate your search effectively using platforms like Google and Google Scholar.
* **Visualizing Research Connections:** Discover how **Connected Papers** can help you map out the relationships between academic publications, making it easier to identify key works.
* **AI-Powered Document Analysis with NotebookLM:** See how to upload your PDFs to **NotebookLM** for instant summarization, intelligent prompt generation, and even the creation of audio overviews and interactive discussions based on your source material.
* **Deep Research with Google Gemini:** Explore **Google Gemini's deep research feature**, which utilizes web-Browse capabilities to generate comprehensive reports and audio summaries on complex topics.
* **Efficient Reference Management:** A brief look at how I use **Zotero** to organize all the interesting publications I find throughout the process.

This workflow is aimed at significantly reducing the time typically spent on understanding a new subject and identifying core publications, ultimately boosting the efficiency of your research process.
