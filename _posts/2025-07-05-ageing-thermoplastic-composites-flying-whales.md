## The Challenge of Durability: Thermoplastic Composites in Extreme Environments

Thermoplastic composites are increasingly vital in the aviation and aerospace sectors due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio and design flexibility. However, their long-term performance in harsh operational environments, characterized by exposure to UV radiation and moisture, remains a critical area of investigation. Understanding the degradation mechanisms of these materials is paramount to ensuring the safety and longevity of aerospace components.

Our latest research dives into the ageing behavior of three prominent carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites: CF/PPS, CF/PEI, and CF/PEEK. We subjected these materials to **accelerated ageing tests under combined UV radiation and condensation** in a controlled environmental chamber. By meticulously characterizing their degradation through various advanced techniques, we provide crucial insights into how these materials withstand the rigors of real-world aerospace applications.

### Methods used

* **Accelerated Ageing Methodology:** We successfully implemented an accelerated ageing protocol in an environmental chamber, allowing for controlled exposure to UV and humidity, mimicking extreme aerospace conditions.
* **Diverse Degradation Mechanisms:** Our comprehensive characterization, utilizing techniques such as tensile testing, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), confocal microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), revealed distinct degradation mechanisms for each composite type.

### Degradation related findings

* **CF/PPS Behavior: The Toughener**. We observed that CF/PPS tends to increase cross-linking and brittleness under combined UV and condensation exposure. Surprisingly, after 28 days of exposure, its tensile strength (how much pull it can withstand before breaking) actually *increased*. However, this came with reduced crystallinity, which can affect other properties.
* **CF/PEI and CF/PEEK Behavior: The chain breaker**. In contrast, CF/PEI and CF/PEEK primarily exhibited **chain-scission degradation mechanisms**. This means the long polymer chains were breaking down into smaller pieces. 
    * For CF/PEI, this led to a decrease in its glass transition temperature ($T_{g}$), a critical temperature where the material starts to soften.
    * For CF/PEEK, its crystallinity *increased*, which might sound good, but coupled with chain scission, both CF/PEI and CF/PEEK showed a **reduced tensile strength** after exposure.
* **Visually**, the changes were noticeable too. CF/PPS and CF/PEEK initially discolored, turning brownish, and then became shinier and rougher as the polymer wore away, exposing the carbon fibers beneath. CF/PEI didn't change color much, but its surface became rougher early on. Under a microscope, cracks and cavities formed, revealing the underlying carbon fibers.
