Ilyass Tabiai lives in Montréal with his spouse and their two cats. As a Professor, his main goal is to help students keep an open mind, or in other words, question paradigms that appear to be immutable.
For Ilyass Tabiai, learning and understanding the literature represent a tedious task, but doing so enables him to flush out the “small” problems that people are sometimes reluctant to admit; and in his opinion, “this is where problems are resolved. One must not be afraid to address the unspoken, despite the discomfort it may cause. In order for mechanics or mathematics to evolve, one must avoid taking values for granted!”
